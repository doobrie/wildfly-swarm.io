=== Turn the web frontend into a service
At this point the web frontend still resides with WildFly. So we turn it into a Swarm service before we proceed,
to be able to run it locally. Make sure to also advertise it as a service, like we did in Step 3.
Once this is done we don’t need WildFly anymore. It’s good to terminate the process to avoid port conflicts.

NOTE: When you turn the everest module into a swarm service,
you change the packaging of `war` to `jar`. This also requires you to move the web resources from `src/main/webapp` to `src/main/resources`.

=== Introducing fault-injection techniques and hystrix for resilience.
Before thinking about resilience it's actually useful to inject faults to demonstrate the need for enhanced fault handling capabilities. link:/tutorial/toxy[Appendix A] contains some information on how to use a fault-injection proxy to easily achieve this.

Once we can simulate faults, we implement a circuit breaker using Hystrix and complete this activity by installing the link:/tutorial/hystrix[Hystrix dashboard] to monitor IPC interactions and the system state.

NOTE: Hystrix runs the command in it’s own thread pool. Doing that in a EE environment requires you to think twice about what that demarcation actually means.

== Concepts
* Bulkheads and circuit breaking (hystrix)
* Fault injection techniques

== Tasks
* Start each service, but this time include the web frontend that moved from WildFly:
 `java -Dswarm.project.stage=production -Dswarm.bind.address=<PUBLIC_IP> -Dconsul.host=<CONSUL_IP> -jar target/everest-web-swarm.jar`
* Focus on a single service, for instance the order service and it’s client invocation. (The client to the order service is the web frontend)
* Redirect traffic through the fault injection proxy. For the sake of simplicity you may just change the service lookup URL in `ConsulDiscovery.java`
* Prepare the link:/tutorial/toxy[Fault-injection proxy] to introduce random errors (i.e. HTTP 503, see link:/tutorial/toxy[Appendix A])
* Use the web frontend to order books and watch it fail randomly
* Add the hystrix dependency to the maven pom.xml (`everest` module)
* Add a hystrix command to the order client that can handle (i.e. compensate) the faults

== Outcome
* You can run the web frontend using java -jar (no need for WildFly deployment anymore)
* After adding the circuit breaker, your service client you handle the faults gracefully
* The web frontend remains operational, the service doesn’t cascade through the system

== Documentation
* https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki[Hystrix Overview]
* https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix/wiki/Getting-Started[Hystrix API]
* https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Observable[Observable API]
* http://docs.couchbase.com/developer/java-2.0/observables.html[A good intro to Observables]

== Alternative Activities
* Caching of the catalog service responses to fallback gracefully
* Examine possible circuit thresholds (i.e. at what point do we permanently open the circuit)?
* Replace the home baked service lookup for the frontend with the topology service. It’s bound to JNDI (see WildFly Swarm documentation)
